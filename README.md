In this Poll UI Design, there is a content box with a header and some options. At first, there is only an option name with a light grey border and a radio circle on each option but when you select an option then the selected option border color will be changed into the body color, the radio circle color also changed and checked, and the total percent and the progress bar of each option also visible as you can see in the preview image.
